## Using OWASP to check your code

Checking code for OWASP vulnerabilities in smaller projects must not be 
expensive and exclusive for the players of security products.
If you use Maven you can simply put this piece of code to your building pom 
file and everything runs out of the box.

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
    <version>6.5.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <ossindexAnalyzerEnabled>false</ossindexAnalyzerEnabled>
        <retireJsAnalyzerEnabled>false</retireJsAnalyzerEnabled>
        <nuspecAnalyzerEnabled>false</nuspecAnalyzerEnabled>
        <assemblyAnalyzerEnabled>false</assemblyAnalyzerEnabled>
        <excludes>
            <exclude>your.company.package:*</exclude>
        </excludes>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>check</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Only small disadvantage of that is the limited number of request to OWASP. This
can be a problem in bigger projects. For that, unfortunately, you need to 
create an OWASP paid account :)
